<p>Today, I realised that I didnt need to download any extra programs such as MySQl to
    access databases or learn MySQL. It's been a slower than usual process but
    I've definitely been learning as I go forward. This 
    <a href=https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/mysql.html">link </a> has given me the information I need to 
connect to service to access data in the MySQL database by configuring MySQL server properties, 
starting the MYSQL server, creating and connecting to the database instance, creating database tables and working with 
the created data. This includes running a database script </p>
